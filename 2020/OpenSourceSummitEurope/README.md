# Learning the Basics of Apache NiFi for IoT

* https://osseu2020.sched.com/event/eCFz?iframe=no

* I will teach the basics of using Apache NiFi to process data commonly acquired from IoT including MQTT, REST, Kafka, Syslog, tailing files, python
output, sFTP, files and more. We will walk through some best practices for building flows for solving IoT ingest issues for sensor data and other edge data sources.
